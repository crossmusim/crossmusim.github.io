      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Music similarity retrieval is fundamental for managing and exploring relevant content from large collections in streaming platforms. This paper presents a novel cross-modal 
        contrastive learning framework that leverages the open-ended nature of text descriptions to guide music similarity modeling, addressing the limitations of traditional uni-modal 
        approaches in capturing complex musical relationships. To overcome the scarcity of high-quality text-music paired data, this paper introduces a dual-source data acquisition approach
        combining online scraping and LLM-based prompting, where carefully designed prompts leverage LLMs’ comprehensive music knowledge to generate contextually rich descriptions. 
        Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks through objective metrics, subjective evaluations, 
        and real-world A/B testing on a commercial music streaming platform.

      <h2>In-House Collection</h2>
      <p>
        Our in-house collection comprises 200k songs curated from a commercial music streaming platform, seelcted from among the most popular tracks. These songs have been manually labeled by professional musicians and are annotated 
        with tags spanning eight categories, including genre, mood, scenario, media categorization, audio properties, language types, regions, and years. For this study, we focus on three relevant musical aspects: genre, mood, and
        scenario, and select songs that contain at least one tag in each of these dimensions, resulting in a subset of 150k songs. The tagging system includes a total of 1,423 unique tag types organized in a multi-level hierarchy, 
        ranging from coarse-grained labels to fine-grained labels.
